README
======
This is my effort in trying to unify and archive reusable pieces of code, but
also to provide a platform for easy cross-development on Mac OS X, Windows,
Android and iOS. This is achieved through a service-oriented architecture with a 
few well-defined "standardized" interfaces. 
The application should register what kind of services (ie, "sound", "graphics")
it needs and the build process will orchestrate a configuration for that 
application on that particular platform.

Utilities
---------
This is the most easily reusable part of the library; all that is needed to use
in another project is often just a copy-paste of the header files. It's also heavily tested using unittests. Contains:
  * Vector data types for linear algebra, colors, etc.
  * Matrix data types and operations
  * Generic algorithms (lerp, clamp, saturate, etc)
  * Logging classes

Framework
---------
The framework part of the library does not pretend to be almighty; if you need,
it should be possible to rely on implementation specifics. An example of this
might be to get the HWND of a window on Windows platforms so you can display
something extra nice, or just accessing something that hasn't propagated up to
the "standardized" interfaces yet. This extension mechanism is implemented
similar to OpenGL extensions; an implementation can expose functions mapped
by a string which the clients can use to identify the feature.


Copyrights
==========
Everything is copyright (C) Peter Backman, for now. I will look into the
licensing later, but the idea right now is:
  * The utility lib will be licensed quite liberally, a bit less strict than
    BSD 3-clause.
  * Framework part (including build system, interfaces, implementations, etc)
    will be a little bit more strict. Maybe not by much, though.
    
    
Building
========
cd build && cmake . -DTARGET=<TARGET> && make

<TARGET> can be any of:
  * tests -- create buildsystem for all generic non-implementation tests
   
The build system is tweaked for Xcode and Makefiles, so go ahead and test
them :)
