README
======
The reason behind this project is to provide easy to use common utilities when
applying linear algebra to software development.
Usage should be simple; just copy the header file you need into your
project. You don't have to compile or link anything.

Copyrights
==========
Basically quite open. You can use it in closed and open source, for commercial
use or for free. You can't sell this software directly, nor can you use my name
for modifications you've done.
        
Building
========
cd build && cmake . -DTARGET=<TARGET> && make

<TARGET> can be any of:
  * tests -- create buildsystem for all generic non-implementation tests
   
The build system is tweaked for Xcode and Makefiles, so go ahead and test
them :)
